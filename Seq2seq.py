'''Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) Model with Attention:

This architecture consists of an encoder-decoder structure with attention mechanism.
The encoder takes the input sequence (sentence with spelling errors) and encodes it into a fixed-length representation, capturing contextual information. You can use recurrent neural networks (RNNs) such as LSTM or GRU to process the input sequence.
The attention mechanism helps the model focus on specific parts of the input sequence while generating the corrected output. It allows the decoder to dynamically attend to different parts of the input during the decoding process.
The decoder takes the encoded representation and generates the corrected output sequence (sentence without spelling errors). RNNs can be used as the decoder units.
During training, the model is trained to minimize the difference between the predicted corrected sequence and the target sequence (corrected sentence). This can be done using teacher forcing, where the correct output at each time step is fed as input to the next time step during training.
During inference, the trained model generates the corrected output sequence given an input sequence, taking into account the attention mechanism.'''
