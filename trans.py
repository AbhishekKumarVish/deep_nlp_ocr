'''Transformers have shown remarkable success in natural language processing tasks, including spell checking.
The architecture includes a transformer-based encoder-decoder structure. The encoder processes the input sequence, capturing contextual information using self-attention mechanisms. The decoder takes the encoded representation and generates the corrected output sequence, attending to relevant parts of the input using self-attention and encoder-decoder attention mechanisms.
Training and inference processes are similar to the Seq2Seq model, where the model learns to generate the corrected output sequence by minimizing the difference between the predicted sequence and the target sequence during training. During inference, the trained model generates the corrected output sequence given an input sequence.
It's important to note that the ASpell dataset itself is not suitable for training deep learning models directly since it primarily consists of correctly spelled words used for reference. To create a deep learning-based spell checker, you would need a dataset that includes pairs of misspelled words and their corresponding corrections. However, you can still use the ASpell library for spell checking during the post-processing stage after using a deep learning-based spell checker.'''
